# Installing / Loading Required R Libraries

When I'm working on a script from the ground up, the first thing I like to do is install (if not already installed) & load all the libraries that I'm planning on using before I even start thinking about loading and manipulating any data.

### Installing CRAN Packages

Libraries only need to be installed once. After that, they're saved to your computer and you can view them under the **Packages** tab in the bottom right panel on your screen. How do you tell which libraries/packages you need to install? I usually just run the load statements below, and R will tell me if I don't have a package installed

The packages used in this code come from two different repositories, $\underline{C}omprehensive\space\underline{R}\space\underline{A}rchive\space\underline{N}etwork$ (CRAN) and BioConductor. They're installed differently.

CRAN packages can be installed several different ways. The first way is demonstrated in the code chunk below. Alternatively, you can click to the **Packages** tab over on the bottom right of the screen. You'll find an **Install** and **Update** button there that you can use to browse for packages

```{r}
# Don't need run this every time. 
# Only if you need to install a package.
# Just replace the Package in the parentheses with whatever you need installed
# install.packages(R.utils) # Commented out for convenience
```

### Installing BioConductR Packages

BioConductor has its own package manager. Before you can install anything from it, you first need to install the BioConductor manager from CRAN.

```{r}
# install.packages("BiocManager")
```

Then you can install all the BioConductor packages you want! Note, you may be prompted in the console window (bottom left) if you want to update packages. It's generally a good idea. Sometimes a package refuses to update. If that happens, close out of all your R tabs, clear your workspace, and try again. Sometimes incompatible packages can clash and cause really weird errors that are tough to troubleshoot, so I'd recommend keeping things as updated as possible.

```{r}
# Install a specific version of BioConductor core packages
# BiocManager::install(version = "3.18)

# Install latest version of BioConductor core packages
# BiocManager::install()

```

Some BioConductor packages don't install with the core distribution. Do install these add-ons, you can specifically request these packages be installed
This project specifically requires ArtMS
```{r}
# Install a set of specific non-core package. Format: c("Package1", "Package2", etc....)
BiocManager::install(c("artMS"))
```

### Load Packages

Now that in theory everything is installed. Let's load our packages. If you get any errors regarding **Package not found**, just go back and install it! A general rule is the fully lowercase libraries are from CRAN and the CamelCase libraries are from BioConductor

```{r}
# Load Packages
library(MSstats)
library(dplyr)
library(R.utils) # Actually a cran package
library(dplyr)
library(svglite)
library (data.table)
# library (ComplexHeatmap) # not needed in this code
library (circlize)
library (ggplot2)
rotate.x.axis.text <- theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90,vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))
library (magrittr)
library (pbapply)
library(ggrepel)

# Package versions
# MSstats version 4.10.0
# MSstatsTMT version 2.10.0
# MSstatsPTM version 2.4.1
```


# Import Data from Spectronaut Report

### Pull Ben Polacco's code for Spectronaut -> artMS conversion
```{r}
source("../../Krogan bp_utils/spectronautFile2ArtMS.R")
```

### Run artMS Using default settings
```{r}
artmsInput <- spectronautFile2ArtMS("../data/Spectronaut/20240202_080916_LargeScale_BeadTest_Report.tsv", outFilePrefix = "artms/exp1")  
# writing out files is required to get around a problem in artMS using in-memory data.tables

artmsQualityControlEvidenceBasic(artmsInput$config_data$files$evidence, artmsInput$config_data$files$keys, prot_exp = "AB")
```


**Only run this block if you have processed data from Spectronaut** Read in the entire Spectronaut report into memory.

```{r}
# read in entire spectronaut report
#spectronautData.raw <- fread ("./path/to/your/spectronaut/output_report.tsv")
spectronautData.raw <- fread ("../AM Beadtest/20240130_224435_TT000242_Report.tsv")
```

# Clean data

**Only run this block if you have processed data from Spectronaut**

It's recommended to include commonly observed contaminant proteins when processing your proteomic datasets. However, Spectronaut does not remove these entries for you. Fortunately, all contaminant protein accessions are prepended with the text **Cont\_** so we can go through each row in our dataset and toss that data ourselves.

```{r}
# remove all contaminant proteins. We don't want that crap
substring_to_remove <- "Cont_"

# Identify rows containing the contaminant substring
rows_to_remove <- grep(substring_to_remove, spectronautData.raw$PG.ProteinAccessions)

# Remove rows using the above vector of row indices
spectronautData.ContaminantsRemoved <- spectronautData.raw[-rows_to_remove, ]
```

# Make protein metadata linker table

During data processing via msStats most of the metadata we'd like to include for visualization or functional enrichment analysis is discarded. I find it useful to create a linker table early on containing all the metadata I want to crossmap back in based on a unique identifier. The best one I've found is the Uniprot accession ID column AKA **PG.ProteinAccession**.

**Only run this block if you have processed data from Spectronaut**

```{r}
# scrape a linker table for Uniprot IDs and Protein Names for later visualization
proteinNameCrossLookup <- subset(spectronautData.ContaminantsRemoved, select = c(PG.ProteinAccessions, PG.ProteinNames))

# rename columns for easy merging later
colnames(proteinNameCrossLookup) <- c("Protein", "ProteinName")

# filter to distinct protein IDs. %>% is an operator from the package magrittr which can be used to chain multiple functions together.
proteinNameCrossLookup <- proteinNameCrossLookup %>% distinct(Protein, .keep_all = TRUE)
```

**Only run this block if you have processed data from MaxQuant**

```{r}
# scrape a linker table for Uniprot IDs and Protein Names for later visualization
proteinNameCrossLookup <- subset(maxQuantData.proteinGroups, select = c(`Protein IDs`, `Gene names`))

# rename columns for easy merging later
colnames(proteinNameCrossLookup) <- c("Protein", "ProteinName")

# filter to distinct protein IDs. %>% is an operator from the package magrittr which can be used to chain multiple functions together.
proteinNameCrossLookup <- proteinNameCrossLookup %>% distinct(Protein, .keep_all = TRUE)
```

# Reformat data for msStats Data Processing

Most proteomic pipelines by default do not export data in the format that msStat expects for protein grouping and normalization. Fortunately for us, msStats already has a built-in converter function that we can take advantage of with minimal effort. While it's not the worst thing to reformat this data ourselves, work smarter, not harder.

**Only run this block if you have processed data from Spectronaut**

```{r}
# the optional arguments are recommended in the msStats user guide. Feel free to change if you know better.
global.prepared <- SpectronauttoMSstatsFormat(spectronautData.ContaminantsRemoved,
                                       filter_with_Qvalue = TRUE, ## same as default
                                       qvalue_cutoff = 0.01, ## same as default
                                       removeProtein_with1Feature = TRUE,
                                       use_log_file = FALSE)

```

**Only run this block if you have processed data from MaxQuant**

```{r}
global.prepared <- MaxQtoMSstatsFormat(maxQuantData.evidence, 
                                       maxQuantData.annotations, 
                                       maxQuantData.proteinGroups)
```

# Quality Control Plots of the Raw Data

Now is a good time to take a look at the raw data.

```{r}
hist(log2(global.prepared$Intensity), breaks = 100)
```

```{r}
unique_counts <- peptidesPerCondition %>%
  group_by(Condition) %>%
  summarize(Unique_Peptide_Count = n_distinct(PeptideSequence))

ggplot(unique_counts, aes(x = Condition, y = Unique_Peptide_Count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue", width = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "Unique Peptide Sequences per Condition",
       x = "Condition",
       y = "Number of Unique Peptide Sequences") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 5.5, linetype = "dashed", color = "darkgray") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 10.5, linetype = "dashed", color = "darkgray") +
  rotate.x.axis.text

```

Plot the number of quantified measurements per MS analysis. This is generally more interesting when you're not using match between runs in Spectronaut.

```{r, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 4}


ggplot(data = test, aes(x = paste0(Condition, "_", BioReplicate), fill = Condition)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "count") +
  rotate.x.axis.text # this is defined in the default template of all my Rmd files

ggsave("TransitionsPerSample.svg")
```

```{r}
ggplot (data = global.prepared, aes (x = paste0(Condition, "_", BioReplicate),
                          y = log10(Intensity), 
                          fill = Condition)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  rotate.x.axis.text # this is defined in the default template of all my Rmd files

ggsave("TransitionIntensitiesPerSample.svg")
```

# Use MSstats for protein summarization

This is where we summarize peptides (or peptide transitions depending on your data export format) back into protein groups. Depending on your experiment, you're going to want to turn normalization on or off. For your typical APEX experiment, the control condition doesn't have Biotin Phenol meaning biotin enrichment does not occur. We expect an entirely different population of proteins to be enriched for in the BP samples, so its best to not do any sort of normalization at this point.

```{r}
global.proteinSummarization = MSstats::dataProcess(global.prepared,
                               normalization = 'FALSE',				
                               logTrans = 2,				
                               featureSubset = 'highQuality',				
                               summaryMethod="TMP",
                               censoredInt='NA',				
                               MBimpute=TRUE,				
                               maxQuantileforCensored=0.999)

```

# Plot protein intensities pre-normalization

All of our peptide-level data has now been summarized into protein groups. Let's inspect the intensity distributions of this data. Note: the data process function already log2 transformed this data, so we don't have to ourselves.

```{r}

ggplot (global.proteinSummarization$ProteinLevelData, aes (x = interaction ( SUBJECT, GROUP), y = LogIntensities, fill = GROUP)) + geom_boxplot() + rotate.x.axis.text
ggsave("ProteinIntensities_PostNormalization.svg")

```

```{r}
unique_counts <- global.proteinSummarization$ProteinLevelData %>%
  group_by(GROUP) %>%
  summarize(Unique_Protein_Count = n_distinct(Protein))

ggplot(unique_counts, aes(x = GROUP, y = Unique_Protein_Count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue", width = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "Count of Protein Groups per Condition",
       x = "Condition",
       y = "Number of Protein Groups") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 5.5, linetype = "dashed", color = "darkgray") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 10.5, linetype = "dashed", color = "darkgray") +
  rotate.x.axis.text

ggsave("./UniqueProteinGroupsPerCondition.pdf")
```

# Plot average protein CVs per condition
```{r}
proteomics_data <- global.proteinSummarization$ProteinLevelData %>%
  group_by(GROUP, Protein) %>%
  summarize(CV = sd(LogIntensities) / mean(LogIntensities) * 100)

# Plot the distribution of CV for each group

# Native Carboxylase Enrichment

This is a quality control plot I borrowed from Ben Polacco.If you've normalized your data, it's useful. Without normalization the results are pretty difficult to interpret.

*APEX works by labeling neighboring/interacting proteins with biotin which is then used to purify labeled proteins. There are also proteins that are endogenously biotinylated which will co-purify with the APEX-labeled proteins. Here we look at a subset of these endogenous biotin proteins, and we inspect their post-normalization background levels, which are inversely related to the labeling-efficiency of APEX. More background after normalization implies there is less APEX-labeled signal.*

If you see your control conditions at higher abundance compared to the rest of your samples, great, APEX worked!

```{r}

biotin.carboxylases.up <- c("O00763","P05165","P11498","Q13085","Q96RQ3")

# Do global pairwise comparisons to check for successful APEX enrichment

Another way you can check for successful APEX enrichment is to make volcano plots comparing protein abundances between non-BP vs BP conditions. What you should see is a mass up-regulation of most proteins. If you don't see that, your enrichment likely didn't work, or you have a ton of background binding. To make these comparisons, we can use the GroupComparison function from msStats. To use this function, you need the output from MSstats::DataProcess, and you also have to build a contrast matrix, essentially a numerical vector indicating what experimental conditions you want to compare.

The first thing I like to do is get the ordered list of experimental conditions from the MsStats output. It makes it easier for me to visualize all the experimental conditions in the study, and I base my contrast matrix around the order of this list. You need to stipulate all the conditions that you DataProcess'd together. You unfortunately can't just subselect a handful.

```{r}
global.orderedConditions <- levels(global.proteinSummarization$ProteinLevelData$GROUP)
cat(global.orderedConditions)
```

Angelina wants a pairwise comparison for all possible conditions

Great! From these results, we can definitely see that our APEX labeling worked! If we didn't see a bunch of proteins with large Log2 fold change values, we'd know something went wrong with our labeling.

# Now for the actual experimental comparisons

Okay, so we confirmed the APEX labeling worked using our no-BP controls. Now to make the comparisons we're actually interested in, we need to go back to our original dataset, toss out the no-bp controls, then do the pairwise comparisons all over again.

```{r}
experiment.Samples <- c("0m_40", "0m_50", "0m_60", "0m_70", "0m_80", "5m_40", "5m_50", "5m_60", "5m_70", "5m_80")

experiment.ConditionSubset <- global.prepared[global.prepared$Condition %in% experiment.Samples, ]

experiment.msstatsResults <- MSstats::dataProcess(experiment.ConditionSubset,
                                                  normalization = "EQUALIZEMEDIANS",
                                                  featureSubset = "highQuality",
                                                  censoredInt="0",
                                                  MBimpute=TRUE,
                                                  maxQuantileforCensored=0.999 )

```

# Plot protein intensities pre-normalization

All of our peptide-level data has now been summarized into protein groups. Let's inspect the intensity distributions of this data. Note: the data process function already log2 transformed this data, so we don't have to ourselves.

```{r}

ggplot (experiment.msstatsResults$ProteinLevelData, aes (x = interaction ( SUBJECT, GROUP), y = LogIntensities, fill = GROUP)) + geom_boxplot() + rotate.x.axis.text
ggsave("ProteinIntensities_ExperimentOnly_PostNormalization.svg")
